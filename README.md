# Objective

This was a self-started project to make a template that's an "easy liftoff" to any ReactJS project. I always find myself reorganizing and using the same stuff, so here is my fav things bundled together in a very approachable way!

This will be the start to many new projects on the horizon! If you've stumbled upon this, hope you like what you see! Feel free to star, pull, and start your projects with a bit more organization and more tools at your disposal.

# Getting Started

- go ahead and clone this bad boy.
- cd into the folder and run `npm install`.
- then, `npm start`! That should be it. Pretty easy, eh?

## Progress

04/19 - Set up concurrently to run multiple script commands with `npm start`.
04/19 - Dropped in Sass framework and [spaceBase](https://spacebase.space150.com/).
05/08 - Removed testing folder, js, and files. Out of scope for this project.
05/08 - Reorganized for Component based building and now imports dynamic data via siteData.json at the root of the public folder.
